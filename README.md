EECS-481-Homework-2
===================

Repository for Robert Smart's Homework 2 assignment for EECS 481 Fall 2013


The spec for this assignment did not specify whether or not we had to use XNA for the 
assignment so I used Windows Phone SDK which I already had installed and set up with 
Microsoft Visual Studios 2012.  I also have Visual Studios 2010 installed just in case because 
I've heard that the 2012 version doesn't work well with the Kinect.  For the main project in 
this course we do plan to use VS 2012.  Our group leader sadi he knows a way to get it to work with XNA.
The app I made is a very basic pong-like app.  The user doesn't control the ball or the walls, 
they move on their own. The app does demonstrate animation by having the objects on the screen move and 
it also demonstrates collision detection.  THe ball bounces off the walls and I also made the walls move 
to show that the ball is responding to collision detection with the walls and not just when it reaches 
specific locations.  

To run this you may need to have the windows phone sdk installed so that you can use the windows phone
emulator.
